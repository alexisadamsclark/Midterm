#PART A:

#Question A.1: Use the function above to download all the data for each of the past 4 school years and bind it into a single data frame, using a single function (i.e., one line of code). Note, this may take a minute or two to run, depending on your Internet speed.

download_file <- function(year) {
    link <- glue::glue("https://www.oregon.gov/ode/educator-resources/assessment/TestResults20{year}/pagr_schools_ela_raceethnicity_{year-1}{year}.xlsx")

}

data <- map_df(c(15:18), download_file)

#Conduct some basic data cleaning to make your data file look like the following. Filter for only student groups coded as "White" or "Hispanic/Latino". Select variables related to the number of students in each of the levels (1:4), and not percentages or collapsed levels. Remove any row that has missing data in any of the n variables.

data <- data %>% 
  clean_names() %>% 
  filter(student_group == "White" | student_group == "Hispanic/Latino") %>% 
  select(academic_year, district, school, student_group, grade_level, number_level_1, number_level_2, number_level_3, number_level_4)

Produce a similar plot to the below (noting the school, academic year, and school district) for each of the first 100 unique school/year/district combinations.
